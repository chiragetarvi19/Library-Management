# Library-Management
As the name suggests, the Library Management System is software that handles the complete data of the library. It makes the work of a librarian easier than writing data in a notebook. In the past, the librarians used notebooks to write the books' data and students' names who borrowed that book. So it was complicated to keep track of every book.
If a librarian wants to search for a particular book, that task is very time-consuming. So to make this task easy, programming languages were developed, and C++ language is one of them.

Brief Description of the Project-
I have created separate logins for students and the librarian, in which the librarian is password protected.
In this project, the librarian can add, update, delete and create books and can also assign the books to the students.
The students can also view the list of books available in the entire library database.
Exclusive rights are given to the librarian to add books, issue books, and modify the text.
This project uses file handling to store the data of books in a project.
A Librarian can also be able to change the password.
Reissuing and returning the books are the main features of this project.
The student can also see which student has already borrowed the book.

Modules of this project-
Add Book.
Modify Book.
Delete Book.
